    <h3>A funny story</h3>
        <p>
            I had to attend a one day training at a place that I didn't know. At this time, I was moving by bus and I was following the road with the GPS on my phone. I start walking from the bus stop and noticed that the cars were running fast. Then I realised that I was on a highway parcel... (just a few minutes, luckily).
        </p>
    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p>
            I walked on the highway once because of my GPS.
